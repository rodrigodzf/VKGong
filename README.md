# VKGong

This is an **unofficial** mirror repository for the VKGong software. The original software is available at [here](https://vkgong.ensta-paris.fr/).

From the original website:

*VK-gong is a numerical software for the time simulations of nonlinear (large amplitude) vibrations of thin plates and shells. The code relies on the von Kármán theory for geometrically nonlinear vibrations, explaining the choice of the letters "VK" in the name VK-gong. The code is provided in two languages, Matlab and C++, along with some benchmark example cases to explore the capabilities of the program.*

The matlab code is available in the `matlab` directory, and the C++ code is available in the `src` directory.

The binary data and the temporary results have been removed from this repository.
